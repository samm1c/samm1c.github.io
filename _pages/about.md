Hi! My name is Sammi, and I'm a senior in Computer Science @ Stony Brook University with a passion for software engineering. I love to build applications that can have a positive impact on people's lives. For example, I recently interned at NYC Department of Homeless Services for a program that mentored thousands of homeless students. There, I was able to learn a lot about helping and working with others. I would say that I'm diligent, friendly, and excited to learn and grow my career!  
   
<!-- This semester, I'm looking forward to TA'ing CSE 114 with Professor Ahmad Esmaili and learning more about digital security. -->
